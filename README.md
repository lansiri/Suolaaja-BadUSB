## Introduction
This script automates the deployment of a Salt Minion to a target machine via a USB HID attack device. It uses the Arduino HID library to simulate keyboard input and execute commands on the target system.

---

## Features
- Automatically opens PowerShell as an administrator.
- Downloads and installs the Salt Minion software.
- Configures the minion to communicate with a predefined Salt Master server.

---

## Requirements
1. **Hardware**: 
   - Arduino-compatible HID device (e.g., Digispark, Arduino Leonardo, etc.).
2. **Software**:
   - Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
   - Required libraries: `Keyboard` and `KeyboardLayout_sv_SE`.

---

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect your HID-compatible device (e.g., arduino pro micro) to your computer.

### 2. Code Modification
Before uploading the code, modify the **master IP address** to match your Salt Master server's IP:

```cpp
String masterIP = "127.0.0.1";
```
Replace 127.0.0.1 with your desired Salt Master's IP address. For example:

```
String masterIP = "192.168.1.100";
```

Replace `KeyboardLayout_sv_SE` with target keyboard layout.

### 3. Uploading the Code
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Select your HID device from **Tools > Board**.
- Select the correct **port** from **Tools > Port**.
- Click **Upload** to flash the script onto the device.

---

## How to Use
1. Connect the programmed HID device to the target machine's USB port.
2. Wait for the device to execute the script automatically (this process takes approximately 10â€“15 seconds).
3. Verify the Salt Minion installation by checking the master server's status.
